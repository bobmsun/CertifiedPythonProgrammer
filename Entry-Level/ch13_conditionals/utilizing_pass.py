    pass     # pass is no-op, non-operational statement.  It doesn't do anything because we cannot create a block that doesn't have anything

# pass: I don't want to do anything


# If we need certain functions to exist, but we don't want to write the implementation just yet. 
# We can write the function's name and add pass as the body, so it's there as a placeholder so that we can come back to it later
