This is not a block comment.
(表象上，像是一个 block comment；但其实不是)
This is a multi-line string.
This is an object. The compiler will turn this into binary code. 
So this is not free. A comment is free.

Python does not have block comment.
So if you want to comment multiple lines, you will have to comment each line individually.
