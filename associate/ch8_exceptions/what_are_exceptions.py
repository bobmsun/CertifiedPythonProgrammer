# SyntaxError happens before our programe runs vs. Exceptions happen at runtime


# A syntax error is kind of the only error type that is not an exception for us.
# That's going to be something that happens before the program ever runs.
# For the rest of the errors that we're going to check out here,
# or exceptions rather,
# they're going to happen because something didn't go right in our code.


# 例如 TypeError
# 1 + 'a'
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

# Exception handling: sometimes we need to plan for things that could go wrong
