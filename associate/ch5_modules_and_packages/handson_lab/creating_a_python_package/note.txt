# Modules are the main ways we share code in python, but modules are very rarely shared directly.
# Most of the time, modules are gonna be part of the package that can be installed by someone else.
# And then they will have access to modules.

# In this handson lab, we will be creating an installable package that contains modules and expose
# some of the functions directly through the package itself.

# How to create and use packages. And how to create a setup.py so that you can make it an
# installable package.





# 视频中用到的 command：
# mkdir -p
# With the help of mkdir -p command you can create sub-directories of a directory. 
# It will create parent directory first, if it doesn't exist. 
# But if it already exists, then it will not print an error message and will move further to create sub-directories.

# mkdir -p ./packages/words/src/words
# touch ./packages/words/src/words/generator.py
# touch ./packages/words/setup.py
# touch ./packages/words/src/words/__init__.py
